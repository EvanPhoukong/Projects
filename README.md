• Engineered a simulation made up of Internet-connected electronic devices that were capable of communicating with each other. Actors such as devices, alerts and cancellations were implemented as objects storing unique attributes
• Potential issues were conveyed by devices via alerts that propagated continuously. Devices may perform and propagate a cancellation notice to other devices once the issue is resolved
• Displayed timestamps (in milliseconds) for all simulation events including alerts and cancellations
